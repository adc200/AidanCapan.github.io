                        </div>
                    <p>Hello! Pleased to meet you. My name is Aidan Capan, and I'm a senior at Rutgers Business School pursuing a degree in Business Analytics and Information Technology with a minor in Music Technology. I have an immense interest in technology and how technology can be used in any field. With years of technological use behind computer hardware and software, my interest in technology has run through almost my whole life. Wanting to educate myself further, I am sufficient in SQL, Python, Mac OS, Windows OS, HTML, and Javascript. 

                        I believe technology is an ever-adapting tool that enhances effectiveness and efficiency anywhere technology is applied. Wanting to achieve more in the field, I am currently an IT consultant and aim to become a well-versed business analyst in the future. I plan to further increase my current skills while learning new ones in hopes of exploring and discovering new opportunities that can better me as both a person and a professional.</p>
